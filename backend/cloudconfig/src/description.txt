Purpose of the Spring Cloud Config Server
The Spring Cloud Config Server provides centralized external configuration for distributed systems. It allows you to manage configuration files for all your microservices from a central place. Instead of hardcoding configurations within each microservice, you store these configurations in a centralized repository (like Git), and the Config Server provides these configurations to each microservice at runtime.



Key benefits:
Centralized Management: Manage configurations for all environments (e.g., dev, test, prod) in one place.
Dynamic Configuration Updates: You can change configuration properties without redeploying your services. The Config Server can push the changes to your microservices.
Version Control: Storing configurations in a Git repository allows you to track changes and roll back if necessary.
